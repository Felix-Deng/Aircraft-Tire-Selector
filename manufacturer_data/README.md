# Manufacturer Data 

To test and validate our program, we retrieved aircraft tire engineering data from Michelin Aircraft Tire. 

Specifically, we focused on bias type VII, presented with the three part (inch code) nomenclature.

Notes: 
- The Three Part Nomenclature in tire descriptions may contain a prefix designation by B, C, H, or *. 
- \* in tire description prefix: this dimensional data for this size was defined in metric units which, for consistency, has been converted to english units.
